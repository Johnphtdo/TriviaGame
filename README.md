# About TriviaGame
In this application, I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate the HTML. 

To start the application, the user must click on "start game". The user will be shown trivia questions over the popular sitcom "Friends". Upon hitting submit or being timed out, the user will be given a report showing the amount of trivia questions that they got right, wrong, or left unanswered.
